### What I learned

I had a lot of fun making this game. I wanted to make something fun to test my skills and this project met the objectives. I used the math.random function to let the game create itself. Every color is dictated by the math.random function and so is the placement of the box. 


### Continued development
Here are some developments I would like to make:
- Improve Responsivity 
- Add a level 2
